This is the wiki page for Wiktor notebook engine, built using... itself (would be a crime if it wasn't).

## What is it

Wiktor is a generic unordered wiki/blog/notebook engine inspired by [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), aimed at being simple to use and extend.

While Tiddlywiki is no doubt powerful, to me it felt a bit clunky and a bit _too_ powerful, so I made my own thingâ„¢.

At the moment it's in prototype stage, the engine changes constantly with new additions, stuff moves out and in.
When I think it has the features I think it should need, it will hit v1 and I will begin a refactoring iteration towards v2.
