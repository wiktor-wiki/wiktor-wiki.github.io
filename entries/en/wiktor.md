This is the wiki page for Wiktor wiki engine, built using... itself (would be a crime if it wasn't).

## What is it

Wiktor is a generic out-of-order wiki engine inspired by Tiddlywiki, primarily aimed at being simple and easy to use.
It works by rendering markdown entries on-demand with some additional improvements layered on top like responsive tables and code highlighting.

## Why is the code awful

At the moment it's in prototype stage, the engine changes constantly with new additions, stuff moves out and in.
When I think it has the features I think it should need, it will hit v1 and I will begin a refactoring iteration towards v2.
